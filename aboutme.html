 <font size="2">Greetings! My name is Rylee Fabian! I have many goals I wanna achieve, but what is the one thing i really enjoy doing? Well, I enjoy play video games and like to stream them on a website called Twitch. As of now I do it every weekends and have maybe 3 people watch. That is not too bad considering the fact i'm not that well known. Why is it I wanna do this? I wanna do this because I love to make people laugh and have a good time. My plan first is to complete high school, and maybe consider doing it as a job if that can happen.</font>

   <font size="2">People say that I am a very nice person and I tend to have a lot of patience. I am always motivated to do anything that I strive for (which in this case is streaming). With me, I just follow directions and do my job at school. Since I don't do any extra activities outside, I just go for the good grades I can get. Working with people is one of my favorite things to do only because I am a very cooperative person and helping people is what I do. From past experiences, for example from previous grades, I have learned that studying material is all you really need to do to succeed. I am not that intelligent, however, I still do very well in school only because I do a lot of studying. From this, I was able to get almost straight A's and nothing under a B grade.</font>

 <font size="2"> Overall, once high school is out of the way, I will start to think about going into the pathway of live streaming and having other people watch me. I hope I can get well known into the community and grow at a fast rate. Thank you so much for taking the time to get to know me just from this. Go ahead, feel free to explore the rest of my page and I hope you have a fantastic day! :)</font>
