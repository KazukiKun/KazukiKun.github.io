  <p>My name is Rylee, I took this computer class because I am interested in computers. I would love to get into detail with it and soon have a job based on what I learned. I plan to go to college and get a degree there, I'm not that smart so that's why I take the time to study the material in class. Oh and another thing, I watch a lot of anime and its cool. Playing games is what I do best, mostly Fortnite at the moment. Thanks for checking me out!</p>
