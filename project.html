<font size="4">With my app, when you start it up you are greeted with the screen saying Welcome To The Anime Wallpaper Generator! When you click the button you get a sound that says Thank you! By doing so I downloaded the sound file and put it in the block of codes When RandomSound gets pressed, the sound file gets played. Next, on the block of code that is named buttonGenerate when pressed, a random image from the .jpg files gets chosen. One of the difficulties that I faced when making this app is the block of code that generates the random image when you press the button. What I did to fix it was change the variable from setpic to listofanimepics when the variable was setpic only one picture was staying after pressing the button. From changing it to listofanimepics it would generate a random photo from the list of .jpg files. The development of this whole app was independent work. <a href="animewallpapers.apk">Click Here to download the .apk file</a></font>
