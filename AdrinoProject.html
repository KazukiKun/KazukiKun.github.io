  <h2>Video Narration</h2>
<font size="5">For our Audrino Project, we made some sort of a light show using the LEDs. The intention of this project is that the LEDs match the music. So it both syncs. As though it sounds pretty easy to make there were many problems as we were going through this project. The connecting of the wires were pretty easy, but the one that was most difficult was the coding process.</font>
<h3>Written Response</h3>
<font size="4">While making our Audrino Project, we first had to start working with the breadboard and plugging in a lot of jumper wires. We then had to make sure our code matched the pins so the LED would turn on. This part had some problems. We needed to plug in some wires on a positive end and a negative end. Once we got that the LEDs started to work. We now had to work on making the code in order for the lights to sync with the music. Problems we were facing is that the light wouldn't dim all the way. So we had to write seperate code for it to work. The music code already came with one LED code. But we needed to add an extra lines of code for it to blinkm and to also blink on the right tempo. Once we got that working the LEDs started to dim down and light back up with the music. The coding process was the hard part because the pins would not work and the pins always needed to be moved. After that was solved, the light show started to work. <a href="AudrinoCPP"></a></</font>
