  <h2>Video Narration</h2>
<font size="4">The basic idea of this whole thing was to make a python code that selects random questions on the list. The code will select a question and you pretty much just answer it. If you get it wrong, you can answer it again. If you get it right, you go on to the next question. Its pretty self explainatory. Just a fun little python game.
<h3>Written Response</h3>
<font size="4">The whole purpose of the code is that it's supposed to choose random questions from a list. Everytime you get the question wrong, it'll give you the same question until you answer it right. Once you answer it right it'll choose another question at random. This project was a collabortive project and my partner and I had some issues. One issue is that the random function was not randomizing the questions. So you would get the same question everytime. The way this was resolved is that we had to make a while loop and made sure to put every function in the while loop so the list can be chosen at random. Another issue we had was that even though you get the question right it'll still give you the same question. We fixed that by changing the list around and putting more functions in the while loop.</font>
